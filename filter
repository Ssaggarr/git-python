#instead of writing is_even outside the code we can directly again mention in one line

#MAPS
#say now i want to double the the list from even

# def double_it(n):
#     return n*2
even=list(filter(lambda n :n%2==0,num))

#REDUCE
#say if you want to reduce list by adding 
#same method but its not list anymore
#also reduce 
def sum_it(a,b):
    return a+b

# tha above again it can be reduced to one line using lambda






#THE ENTIRE ABOVE CAN BE REDUCED TO THIS 
#EVEN THIS CAN BE FURTHER REDUCED BUT LINE WILL BE LONGER
